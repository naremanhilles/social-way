  description: `Caitlin Evans recently moved to London to study her passion of creative writing, and to discover the exciting experiences the East End has to offer.
  Resting proudly on the River Lea is Barge East, a 114 year old Dutch cargo barge that has been converted into a bar and kitchen by three childhood friends. The restaurant was opened in 2018 and is already rated as one of London’s top restaurants on TripAdvisor.
  It’s easy to see why.You can feel the warmth and personality they poured into the transformation, and how their vision came to life.
  I booked for a late evening in April and upon arriving I could instantly envision Barge East’s outer decking as the perfect spot for canal-side summer sunset drinks. (It’s moored on the watery border between Fish Island, Hackney Wick and the Olympic Park).
  Stepping aboard the boat and descending down the stairs was like entering a secret hide - away – cosy and atmospheric, tucked away from the outside world.The warm - toned lighting, rustic furniture, and live music(smooth clarinet played by Luke Eira) made for a perfectly designed evening mood.`,
